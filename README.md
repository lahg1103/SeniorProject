## Working With the Database (Development ONLY)

We are working with Flask-SQLAlchemy which is a wrapper for SQLite. This requires Flask-Migrate and Flask-SQLAlchemy libraries in order for this to work.
To get started from scratch, you'll need to have your keys in order.

### How to Generate Secret Keys
```bash
python
import secrets
print(secrets.token_hex(32))
```
#### copy the output

### Create .env file
```bash
touch .env
```
#### Add the following (replace 'YOUR-SECRET-KEY' with the token you generated earlier):
```python
FLASK_SESSION_KEY='YOUR-SECRET-KEY'
```

### Inside app.py under if __name__ == '__main__':
#### Uncomment the following lines before running
```python
    # with app.app_context():
    #     db.create_all()
```
#### Run app.py
```bash
python app.py
```
#### You should see a new folder 'instances/' in the root directory holding your database.

## Updating the Database Schema

Next, we want to make sure you have the most updated database schema available. This is where Flask-Migrate comes in.
The versions of the database are under the migrations directory in the root.

#### Get the latest by running this command

```bash
flask db upgrade
```
